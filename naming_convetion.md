- Functions and Variables
  - Use camel case, exported functions and variables start with uppercase. (unexported/private are lowercase)
  - Constant should use all capital letters and use underscore _ to separate words. Eg. INT_MAX
  - If variable type is bool, its name should start with Has, Is, Can or Allow, etc.
  - Avoid cryptic abbreviations. Eg: usrAge := 25
- what you don't want to export (make importable)
  - camelCase
- what you want to export
  - PascakCase
- constants
  - SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- bool
  - is, has, can, allow
- package 
  - in src/encoding/base64 is imported as "encoding/base64" but has name base64, not encoding_base64 and not encodingBase64
  - single word
- Interface
  - Read**er**, Writ**er**, Add**er**
  - use MixedCaps or mixedCaps rather than underscores to write multiword names.
  - Use prefix I Eg. IUser, IRead, etc. One con - searching for interfaces across codebase is harder due to I
  - Use suffix Interface. Eg. UserInterface, ReadInterface, etc.
- file name
  - Generally, file names are single lowercase words.
  - Go follows a convention where source files are all lower case with underscore separating multiple words.
  - Compound file names are separated with `_`
  - File names that begin with “.” or “_” are ignored by the go tool
  - Test files in Go come with suffix `_test.go` . These are only compiled and run by the `go test` tool.
  - Files with os and architecture specific suffixes automatically follow those same constraints, e.g. `name_linux.go` will only build on linux, `name_amd64.go` will only build on amd64.
