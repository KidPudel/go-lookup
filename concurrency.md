# Goroutines
> Goroutines - lightweight threads.

Unlike Kotlin's coroutines, which are kind of workers in a thread, **Goroutines are _actual threads_**, but way more lightweight.  

Unlike usual kernel threads, that are managed by operating system, **goroutines are _user-space threads managed by Go runtime_**.

```go
func sleepTrack(start int) {
  for i := 0; i < 9; i++ {
    fmt.Println("Sleeping, which started at ", start)
    time.Sleep(1000)
  }
}
```

```go
go sleepTrack(start: 19)
```
⬆️ starts a new goroutine running ⬇️
```go
sleepTrack(start: 19)
```

The evaluation of `sleepTrack` and `start` happens is current goroutine,  
While executing happens in a new goroutine.

> IMPORTANT: Goroutines run the same address space, so accessing shared data MUST be in synchronized way (to avoid deadlocks and rase conditions), for that Go has useful primitives like mutexes and atomic for protecting shared data accross Goroutines


# Channels
> Channels are typed conduct (pipe, tube), through which you can send and receive data with the help of channel operator `<-`

### send data through channel
```go
func countSum(arr []int, c chan int) {
  sum := 0
  for i, v := range arr {
    sum += v
  }
  // sending data through conduct
  c <- sum
}
```

### receiving data from channel
```go
rightSide := <-c
```

## Creating channel
```go
c := make(chan int)
```
